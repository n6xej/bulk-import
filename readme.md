# FHIR Bulk Data Import Operation ($import)

This repository contains two very early stage proposals for a FHIR Bulk Data Import Operation. 

While the [FHIR Bulk Data Export Operation](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/export.html) has been balloted by HL7 and implemented in multiple production servers, the Import Operation is still at an early stage and is not ready for use outside of prototyping. If you're interested in helping to move this forward, please review and test one or both of the proposals below. Feedback is welcome - feel free to open pull requests and issues in this repository, or to join the discussions in the Bulk Data stream on https://chat.fhir.org and the Bulk Data track at FHIR Connectathon events!
